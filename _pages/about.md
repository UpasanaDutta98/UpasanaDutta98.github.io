I am a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/), at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), working in the [Penn Media Accountability Project group](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/project/penn-map/) of the [CSS Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Duncan Watts](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/duncan-j-watts-phd) and [Aaron Clauset](https://aaronclauset.github.io/).

My research involves developing computational models to understand what governs human behavior in social systems, such as news production and consumption across traditional media (e.g., TV) and social media platforms. More broadly, I am interested in applying computational methods on digital platforms to study user engagement, political polarization, online extremism, misinformation, biases related to gender, race, and ideology, as well as its broader impact on society.To tackle these questions, I use tools from machine learning, social network analysis, natural language processing, and causal inference.

Prior to joining Penn, I earned a Master's in [Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) from the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/), where I was advised by [Aaron Clauset](https://aaronclauset.github.io/) and [Dan Larremore](https://larremorelab.github.io/dan/), and collaborated closely with [Bailey K. Fosdick](https://www.baileyfosdick.com/). As a part of my Master's thesis, I developed a method for sampling networks from the degree-preserving configuration model using a Markov chain sampler. Concurrently, I also deveoped interests in analyzing human behavior in real-world social systems, and worked on analyzing how interactions with Russia's Internet Research Agency influenced Twitter users' behavior during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
